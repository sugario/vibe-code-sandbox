# 🎶 vibe-code-sandbox 🏖️

Welcome to the sandbox — a place where code comes to **vibe, break, and sometimes shine**.  
This is not a polished repo. It's a **dumping ground for experiments, snippets, half-baked ideas, and random coding sessions**.

## 🌌 What's inside?

- 🧩 Tiny code snippets
- ⚡ Quick hacks & prototypes
- 🎨 Creative experiments
- 🗑️ Abandoned trails of thought (a.k.a. junk code with personality)

## 🎛️ How to use this repo?

- Clone, browse, vibe.
- Nothing here is guaranteed to work, but hey — that’s half the fun.
- Steal ideas, remix, or just laugh at old commits.
